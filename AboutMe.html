        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p id ="para">Hello, my name is Chow Keng Shion and I am currently a year one student in Ngee Ann Polytechnic studying the Diploma in Information Technology. The reason why I chose to study the Diploma in Information Technology at Ngee Ann Polytechnic because I have realised that everything around me has integrated the use of technology. I believe that through my three years in Ngee Ann Polytechnic, I will be able to equip myself with necessary skills to allow me to join the IT workforce with ease or aid me in my future education. Currently I do not have a strong interest in anything in particular but I hope to find interest in something before I graduate from Ngee Ann Polytechnic. One thing I really enjoy doing is spending time with my friends. My friends and I would go shopping together, visit the arcade or even just chilling at a void deck to have meaningful conversions and I would still enjoy every second spent. Although I am not musically inclined, I do enjoy listening to a plethora of music whenever I can, my music taste can range from chill and Lo-Fi songs to pop rock or EDM.</p>
